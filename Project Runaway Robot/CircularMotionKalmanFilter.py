"""
An implementation of the Extended Kalman Filter that specializes in estimating
circular motion variables, including x and y positions, heading direction, and
turning angle and distance traveled between measurements.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is the nonlinear version of Kalman Filter that
can consider nonlinear dynamic systems. In EKF, the transition and observation
models do not have to be linear, but has to be differentiable. In the case of
circular motion here, the assumption is valid and thus EKF is applicable.

    The CircularMotionKalmanFilter class extended the original KalmanFilter by
    implementing a nonlinear transition model and focusing on using m = 2D
    position measurements to estimate n = 5D variables, including:
        1. x position of the robot
        2. y position of the robot
        3. the robot's current heading direction
        4. the robot's turning angle between each measurements
        5. the distance traveled between each measurements
    Since the five variables to estimate do not form a linear dynamic system,
    the transition matrix F is defined to be the Jacobian of the transition
    model.
    The estimation update step is the same as the original Kalman Filter since
    the observation model H remains linear.
